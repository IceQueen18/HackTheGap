        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>WWD is a US-based platform that acts as a connecting point between people and social change. By hosting diverse social projects from various parts of the world, WWD helps you help the world with a click.</p>
        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>We are committed to connecting the world to the most urgent issues different countries are currently facing. Many people would like to help by donating (or other forms) to countries or to help mitigate crises they are connected to or feel touched by. However, the majority of people do not know where to find the spaces where they can take action, and that is why we created WWD.</p>
        <h3>Our Belief</h3>
        <p>WWD is created on the belief that everybody, no matter which part of the world they are from, deserves support and awareness of their socio-political situation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not hold any political ideology that discriminates people or projects based on their focus groups.</li>
            <li>We do not get sponsorship or support from any political party or their values, since we are an independent organization.</li>
            <li>We do not advertise any project or initiative as ours; we serve as an intermediary platform and do not express our views or opinions on certain issues.</li>
        </ul>
